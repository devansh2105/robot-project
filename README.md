# robot-project

As part of the final project for my imperative problem-solving class in C at Grinnell College, I wrote this program to control the Scribbler robots to perform a robot parade. This project envisions a parade of robots, in which each robot follows a common script that specifies actions along a pre-determined route â€” both within the classroom and into the hall.
